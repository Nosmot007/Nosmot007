Hey there! I'm Tomson J. Finosh 👋

🚀 Tech Enthusiast | Aspiring Developer | Event Coordinator | Cooking Fanatic

I'm currently studying CSE Engineering at Marian Engineering College. Tech is my passion, and I'm on a journey to master the world of coding! With a roadmap that starts from front-end and leads all the way to back-end development, I love learning about everything tech-related. Here's a little about me:

💻 Tech Aspirant: From front-end to back-end, I'm learning the ins and outs of web development.
🎯 Coordinating Events: I thrive when I'm managing events and bringing people together. Coordination and communication are my superpowers!
👨‍🍳 Cooking Enthusiast: When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen.
💬 Communication Skills: I love connecting with people and motivating others to push boundaries and do great things.
🛠️ Tech I'm learning:
Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-end: Basics of databases, APIs, and more coming soon!

🌱 Always growing:
I'm constantly learning and working towards being the best version of myself, whether that's through coding, event management, or motivating those around me. I strive to do things differently and bring fresh ideas to the table.


Let's build something awesome together!
